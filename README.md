# librime-llm-rerank

A [librime](https://github.com/rime/librime) plugin that reranks IME candidates
with a language model conditioned on the preceding text of the current session.

Developed for the Squirrel (鼠鬚管) fork at
[Habit130/squirrel](https://github.com/Habit130/squirrel). The design spec is
[issue #16](https://github.com/Habit130/squirrel/issues/16); implementation
tickets are issues #17–#22 in that repository. **Issues and progress tracking
live in `Habit130/squirrel`, not here** — this repo receives code PRs only.

## Install

From a librime source tree (e.g. the `librime` submodule of Squirrel):

```sh
librime/install-plugins.sh Habit130/librime-llm-rerank
```

This strips the `librime-` prefix and clones the repo to
`librime/plugins/llm-rerank`, where librime's CMake auto-discovers it. Rebuild
librime with `make librime` from the Squirrel repo root; the plugin dylib lands
in `lib/rime-plugins/`.

## Scope

Simplified Chinese (简体) only, developed against the `luna_pinyin` schema.

## License

BSD-3-Clause, matching librime.
